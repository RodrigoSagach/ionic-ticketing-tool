# Ionic Ticketing Tool

Ionic doesn't seem to keep track of the bower packages in the bower.json file. I have had to use the .gitignore file and add the packages in the bower.json file.

I usually put in the .git-ignore the sublime project file. But this time I've just decided to keep it.

## Updating with Bower

```
After updating dependencies via **bower update** you have to do **ionic io init** again in order to set the current settings for your services.
```
